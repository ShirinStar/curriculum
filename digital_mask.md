## Digital masks - SparkAR
by [shirin anlen](https://shirin.works).

### Essential Questions
- Why do we have the need to cover ourselves? Or maybe it is the need to show ourselves? 
- How can we use AR filters to express ourselves in a new way and maybe celebrated even our indentity? 
- We have to ask, is this technology safe? What Facebook and Instagram are doing with these filters? With our faces?

### Introduction
Social media has made augmented reality significantly more accessible with the introduction of face filters and interactive effects. Anyone can now create and share their own filter with the world. This adds another layer to the way we engage in social media, the stories we create, the way we want to see ourselves, and the identity we design to it.

### Outcomes & Goals
In this session, you will learn how to use [Spark AR Studio](https://sparkar.facebook.com/ar-studio/download/) to program AR effects like face tracking and gesture recognition to create custom filters for Facebook and Instagram. By the end you will be familiar with Spark AR interface, ways to import custume materials, operate transitions, triger interactions and export to social media.     

Duration: 90 min

***as the class will take place online, please feel free to ask questions at any point***

### Materials Needed
No prior knowledge or experience is required.

1. Install in advance [Spark AR Studio](https://sparkar.facebook.com/ar-studio/download/).
2. Download and save materials that were shared prior. 
3. Have an active Instagram account (optional to the ones that want to share their work).

### Vocabulary
* Augmented Reality (AR): overlays of digital content and information onto the physical world — as if they're actually there with you, in your own space. 

* Visual Programing: a language that allows the programmer to create programs by manipulating graphical elements rather than typing textual commands (in Spark AR this part of the interface called the "Patch editor"). 

* 3D Scene: all the information (the description of the geometry, the camera and the lights) are contained within a file refered the 3D scene.

* Face Tracking: a computer vision technology that detects and locates the presence of a human face in a digital image or video.

* Gesture Recognition: a type of user interface that allows computers to capture and interpret human gestures as algorithmic commands. 

* Foreground-Background Separation: a segmentation task, where the goal is to split the image into foreground and background. In semi-interactive settings (like AR filters), the developer/user marks some pixels as “foreground”, a few others as “background”, and it's up to the algorithm to classify the rest of the pixels.

* Layer Mask: a layer that hide another layer.

* Texture: In 3D graphics, a texture is the digital representation of the surface of a 3D object.

### Takeaways & Next Steps
Can you make now your own filter and share with us?<br/>
A challenge: let's create the same filters as physical masks!
